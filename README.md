## Overview

This is the final project of the [SheCodes Plus Workshop](https://www.shecodes.io/learn/workshops).
The SheCodes Workshops have taught me the fundamentals of front-end develpoment.

The goal of this project was to show our knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, and API integration.

This is a simple website utilizing OpenWeather API to check current weather conditions in a searched city or current location. Background and icon images change according to weather report, as well as a unit converstion tool between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for current weather conditions by city name
- Find their current location using a geolocation button
- Convert temperature units between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- See weather icons matching current conditions
- Read the date in a simple format

## My process

### Built with

- InVision App Wireframe
- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

Since my design differed greatly from the step-by-step guides we were given as part of ther workshop, I was forced to learn how to integrate most of the more complex features I wanted to include. In particular, I decided not to use the basic weather icons provided by the API. Because of this, I had to figure out how to change all of my images based on the weather condition given by the API and I learned how to use a switch function to implement this feature.

### Continued development

I am still working on creating responsive websites. As I develop this skill, I will be making this project a resposive design as well.
